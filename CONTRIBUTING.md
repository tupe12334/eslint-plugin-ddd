3. **Create a branch** for your changes: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`

## Development Workflow

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 20.0.0
- pnpm (latest version)

### Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Run tests
pnpm test

# Run tests in watch mode
pnpm test:watch
```

### Development Commands

- `pnpm test` - Run tests
- `pnpm test:watch` - Run tests in watch mode
- `pnpm test:coverage` - Run tests with coverage
- `pnpm lint` - Check code quality
- `pnpm lint:fix` - Fix linting issues
- `pnpm format` - Format code
- `pnpm format:check` - Check formatting
- `pnpm spell` - Check spelling
- `pnpm knip` - Find unused files, dependencies, and exports

## Making Changes

### Code Style

This project uses:

- **JavaScript** (ES modules)
- **ESLint** with `eslint-config-agent` for linting
- **Prettier** for code formatting
- **cspell** for spell checking

### Commit Messages

Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Types**:

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Examples**:

```
feat(rules): add new rule for entity validation
fix(require-spec-file): handle edge case in glob matching
docs(readme): update installation instructions
```

### Testing

- Write tests for all new features and bug fixes
- Ensure all tests pass: `pnpm test`
- Maintain or improve code coverage
- Tests should be in `.spec.js` files next to their corresponding logic files
- Use descriptive test names

### Git Hooks

This project uses Husky for git hooks:

- **Pre-commit**: Runs lint-staged (lints, formats, and spell-checks staged files)
- **Commit-msg**: Validates commit message format using commitlint
- **Pre-push**: Runs full validation (lint, format, spell, knip, tests)

## Submitting Changes

### Pull Request Process

1. **Update your fork** with the latest changes from main:

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull upstream main
   ```

2. **Rebase your branch** (if needed):

   ```bash
   git checkout your-branch
   git rebase main
   ```

3. **Run all checks locally**:

   ```bash
   pnpm lint
   pnpm format:check
   pnpm spell
   pnpm knip
   pnpm test
   ```

4. **Push your changes**:

   ```bash
   git push origin your-branch
   ```

5. **Open a Pull Request** on GitHub with:
   - Clear title describing the change
   - Description of what changed and why
   - Reference to any related issues

### Pull Request Guidelines

- Keep PRs focused on a single feature or fix
- Write clear, descriptive PR titles and descriptions
